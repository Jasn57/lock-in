# Lock In

Lock In helps you stay focused by preventing you from closing or exiting VS Code until you manually disable lock mode.

Perfect for when you need to force yourself to finish a task or stay away from AI, no way out (unless you really mean it).

## Features

Locks VS Code to prevent exiting or closing.

Unlocks only when you manually run the disable command.

## How It Works

Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).

Run Lock In: Enable Lock Mode.

VS Code will be ‚Äúlocked‚Äù ‚Äî closing or quitting will be blocked.

When you‚Äôre done, open the Command Palette again and run Lock In: Disable Lock Mode to unlock it.
